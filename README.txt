Online Manga Downloader 0.1.10
Written by /a/non <anonymousscanlations@gmail.com> and Nagato

=== What is this? ===

It's a downloader for manga hosted on official sites.
Supported sites include:

* Square Enix GanGan (Actibook)
* Kadokawa (Actibook)
* Kondansha (CrochetTime)
* Voyager Store (CrochetTime)
* NicoNico (User-published, Official, EBooks)
* Yahoo Comics (PCViewer/DOR)
* Yahoo Bookstore
* Comic High (PluginFree)
* Club Sunday (Shogakukan)

and much more.

=== Usage ===

Put the URL of the viewer in "Viewer URL" and press "Download."
Look at the examples in the tabs to see what the URLs should look like.
If you have an error, send me a mail with the text in "Log."

=== Passwords ===

If you're tired of filling out your Nico and Pixiv account information over and over,
you can save it by creating a file named "passwords.properties" and putting these
two lines in it (and changing the account information, of course):

nicoUsername=email@lol.com
nicoPassword=password
pixivUsername=email@lol.com
pixivPassword=password

The rationale for storing the password in plain text is explained here:
http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/PlainTextPasswords

I recommend that you exercise caution using this feature.  Make sure that
your Nico and Pixiv password isn't the same as everything, or make another Nico
or Pixiv account with another password.
